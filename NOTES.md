# NOTES

- FONTS:
    - Filter buttons text is in WhitneyHTF-SemiBold font.
    - Runtime font is Arial in the Sketch mockup, though rest of it is Helvetica. I left in Helvetica.
    - Heading font is in Open Sans, which I did.
    - Rating font is Courier in the Sketch mockup, which I did, with a fallback to monospace.
- FILTER:
    - 2000s: I assumed this to mean 2000-2009.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- Movie will always have a `Title`.
- If `movie.Rating` doesn't exist, it should be rated `NR`.
